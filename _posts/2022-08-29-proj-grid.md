*"I stored my memories. I unburdened myself. Let go of control, put on a new face. Surrender. I left the child to meet the woman who dances in her echo."*
-Emma Gardeur, translated by Elizabeth Walton

In *Series Grid Study Sensing Memory*, the dancer plunges us into her past, her life in Kentucky, her dancing, her sex, her upbringing.
These "memories" stored on a controller are re-invoked by the stage director. A random score for a sensitive exploration. In duet.
