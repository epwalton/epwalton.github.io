*Series Grid, Study Touching Memory* is a solo piece that probes into the question: “What happens if a technological tool allowed for any viewer to create the soundscape of a piece, when the meaning and memories attached to each sound are different among dancers and viewers?” I’ve appropriated a 64-button Grid-shaped tool used for music mixing. I take a somatic approach to filling the buttons, selecting sounds that touch on specific memories surrounding monumental experiences in the dancer’s life. A reaction-decision loop of meaning-making occurs between the spectator, who introduces the sound into the space, and the dancer, who generates movement. I integrate the tool into an improvisation-based creation process, during which mover and viewer construct the piece together. Each session, the sound set is altered, therefore altering the creation context. At each session, the set of sounds is new, thus modifying the context of creation. An alternative soundscape is generated at each performance, as a product of another set of spectators.

choreographer and dancer: Elizabeth Prater WALTON
