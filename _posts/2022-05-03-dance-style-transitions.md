We define a _dance style transition_ as a moment -- short- and long-term -- when a dancer changes from training and working in one style of dance, like classical ballet, to another style. We studied this transition experience as an example to understand: the long-term, personal and professional evolution of a professional dancer's career; how to design technology to support the life and practices of professional dancers; and to critically examine the current designs and intentions of movement-based interactive systems for dance learning and choreography. 

We posed the following questions: 
What are their key challenges and strategies for overcoming the challenges of dance style transitions? 
And how do we build technology to support the individual dancer during this process?

We interviewed 12 professional and pre-professional, style-transitioned dancers, like myself, asking for examples of movements or concepts that exist both in classical ballet and their current style of dance. We focused on their experience learning the movement, their strategies in- and outside of the studio, and the external guidance they received during the process.

We identify three key challenges —overcoming habits, learning new forms of movement, transitioning over time— and their strategies for addressing them. We argue that successful tools must help dancers change their mentality about new movement styles, rather than focusing solely on movement mechanics. We suggest three possible implications for design: develop _movement substrates_ that handle multiple movement representations; integrate learning and reflection in a single session; and create movement definitions through movement.
