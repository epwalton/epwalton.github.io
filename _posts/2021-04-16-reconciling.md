To understand opposing approaches in movement-based interaction design, we analyzed research works from what we define as _technology-driven design_ -- which seeks to continuously improve movement and gesture creation and recognition for both the user and the system -- and _experiential design_ -- which explores nuances of aesthetic human movement, cultivates body awareness, and develops methods for movement in embodied design. We discussed future possibilites when integrating the first-person perspective into _technology-driven design_ and capturing from the third-person perspective during _experiential design_ by comparing each project's aspects: target users,  study context, design phase, focuse of movemenbt, and study goal. 


My co-authors and myself offered our investigation to the community through a comparitive essay, published at [the 32nd Francophone Conference on Human-Computer Interaction](https://ihm2020.afihm.org/en/), entitled [Reconciling Technology-Driven and Experiential Approaches for Movement-Based Design](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3450522.3451334).
