**Adrien Bardet**
*Artist-Engineer*

Born in Clermont-Ferrand and currently based in Grenoble, Adrien Bardet is driven by the interaction between digital arts, music and science. Trained in violin at the Conservatoire, he obtained two masters: one focused on digital arts, the other dedicated to research in computer music research at IRCAM in Paris. It was also during this training that Adrien became interested in other media, especially video. He launches into the creation and co-creation of performances whose live-generated visuals sometimes react to sound and music, or sometimes to movement and dance. Today, he navigates between personal projects combining electronic music and interactive visuals, and collaborations in which he contributes his technical and creative expertise.
