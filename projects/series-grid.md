*"I stored my memories. I unburdened myself. Let go of control, put on a new face. Surrender. I left the child to meet the woman who dances in her echo."* <br />
-Emma Gardeur, translated by Elizabeth Walton

*Series Grid, Study Sensing Memory* is a performance exploring the notion of memories, reappropriation and resilience. Using a button-based, MIDI grid controller, the artist chooses to randomly relive past traumas, allowing herself to be “traversed”, made permeable to the proposals sent. This creative project is based previous work in human-machine interaction. The principle is as follows: start from a database of recorded memories (sounds, texts...) chosen by the dancer and stored on the controller. This controller is made available to a dramaturge chosen by the dancer, and then to the public, who witness and participate in this auto-ethnographic research. Elizabeth Walton poses the following question: how can a machine facilitate the creative process while profoundly affecting a dancer? And more broadly, how does technology touch and question our humanity?
