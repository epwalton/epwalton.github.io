Elizabeth Prater WALTON (she/her) is a choreographer, researcher, and dancer. Born in Louisville, Kentucky in the United States, she decided to move to France in 2017. She previously studied full-time with [Kristen Wenrick](http://rivercityballet-ky.org/about-us/) and [Theresa Bautista](http://www.theresabautistadance.com/). She has workshop experience working with Desmond Richardson, Christian Burns, Liz Santoro, Myriam Gourfink, and Ayelen Parolin. 

In 2022, she began her work as a choreographer. Her first piece, *Series Grid, Study Inspecting Memory*, injects technology as an interface between mover and spectactor. In the creation space, she is fascinated by the roles technological systems can appropriate within the constellation of actors or mediate activities in which current actors can take on new roles. She focuses on altering interaction and perception of sensation and movement through prototyping. She believes that this creation-through-research practice inherently lends itself to critical reflection on both the social creation scenario and the technological tool.

She recently explored the relationship between technological interaction and dance during a PhD in Human-Computer Interaction that she defended (March 2022) entitled [*Dance Style Transitions : From Dancers’ Practice to Movement-Based Technology*](https://www.theses.fr/2022UPASG027). I studied under the supervision of [Wendy Mackay](https://ex-situ.lri.fr/people/mackay/) on the Inria research team [ex)situ](https://ex-situ.lri.fr/), a team located at the [Laboratoire Interdisciplinaire des Sciences du Numérique](https://www.lisn.upsaclay.fr/) at the [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en). The project was a part of the ANR project [Element (Enabling Learnability in Movement Interaction)](https://element-project.ircam.fr/) project, coordinated by [Frédéric Bevilacqua](https://frederic-bevilacqua.net/).  I specialized in using qualitative methodologies to understand the nuanced, in-the-wild, first-person perspective of professional dancers and to inform potential technological intervention to support related activities.
