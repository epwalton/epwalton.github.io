Our understanding of the body is difrerent from how a computer "understands" it. Yet we have to communicate with computers. 
Different operational tasks require protocols, labels or training of body forms while sensations remain unexplainable & contexts, fluid.

This fascinates me.

I explored related topics during a PhD that I recently defended (March 2022) entitled [*Dance Style Transitions : From Dancers’ Practice to Movement-Based Technology*](https://www.theses.fr/2022UPASG027). I studied under the supervision of [Wendy Mackay](https://ex-situ.lri.fr/people/mackay/) on the Inria research team [ex)situ](https://ex-situ.lri.fr/), a team located at the [Laboratoire Interdisciplinaire des Sciences du Numérique](https://www.lisn.upsaclay.fr/) at the [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en). The project was a part of the ANR project [Element (Enabling Learnability in Movement Interaction)](https://element-project.ircam.fr/) project, coordinated by [Frédéric Bevilacqua](https://frederic-bevilacqua.net/).

My work focused on integrating the real-life experiences of professional dancers into dance tool design. I specialize in using qualitative methodologies, like semi-structured interviews and structured observation, to understand the nuanced, first-person perspective of events, like a dance style transition, and then to inform potential technological intervention to support related activities.
